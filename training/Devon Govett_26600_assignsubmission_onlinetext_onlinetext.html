<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Urbane Cafe is a lunch and dinner restaurant in downtown San Luis Obispo.  It serves mostly sandwiches and salads, along with some drinks.  The restaurant is conveniently located downtown on Higuera St., in the heart of SLO.  It is easy to walk to from the nearby parking garage or bus stop.  The food is quite good for its price.  Service is fast and friendly, though there is no waitstaff as a traditional restaurant would.  The venue is very nice, including both indoor and outdoor seating, clean tables and chairs, and restrooms on the premises.</p>
<p>Urbane Cafe serves sandwiches, which often include salads.  They have a wide selection of different sandwich types, including options for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  The bread that they serve the sandwiches on is very good.  Not too crunchy or crusty, but not cheap supermarket bread either.  The bread is homemade, and includes herbs and other spices to keep it from getting bland.  The insides of the sandwiches are good as well.</p>
<p>The salads that come with the sandwiches (and I think can be ordered separately as well) are very good.  They are quite simple, with mostly just greens.  They have a very good dressing for the salads as well.  It is a balsamic variant, but different and it's quite tasty.  The salads often also have a few tangerine pieces, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>The staff at Urbane Cafe is very friendly.  They take your order at the front of the store, and you take a buzzer with you to a table and seat yourself.  The buzzer goes off and you go get your food from the counter.  There is no waitstaff like a traditional restaurant and no one to bring food to you, but I didn't find that to be a problem.  Overall, Urbane Cafe is great and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good lunch meal.</p></div></body></html>
