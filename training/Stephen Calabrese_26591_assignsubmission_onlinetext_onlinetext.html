Now 12$ would be a great price if you had great service, a full meal,  and didn't walk away hungry. My sandwich came with BBQ beans in a small Styrofoam  cup. They were good. My tri tip sandwich was also good  however it was insanely  small and felt more like a child's plate in size. I couldn't not believe the  costs for such a small meal. I paid 12$ for a tiny sandwich, cup of beans and no drink. <br /><br />The girl at the counter who quite honestly didn't have the appearance to be in  a customer service position and was neither politer, or attentive. I had to give her my order twice as she clearly was just  not interested. This was somewhat of a surprise to me since I didn't order anything our of the ordinary. In fact, I am willing to bet that most orders are the trip tip sandwich. As for my drink they had a jar of water sitting on the counter. So I could refill my water glass, IF the jar had been full which it wasn't. It was shocking to me to not be able to get ice in my drink.They even appeared annoyed when I asked if I could get the water pitcher refilled. Mind you it was over 100 degrees that day. <br /><br />The Rib Line has been featured on a television show called Man Vs Food. So I was hoping for a really great experience. Unfortunately this is not a sit down restaurant but more of a take out joint .It is in a small strip center just across from Costco and has plenty of parking as there is not much in that center. It appears to be a kind of junky not real attractive place. It has two small tables, and you can not even fill your own drinks should you choose to do so. On the day I chose to go, it was unbearably hot and they have no air conditioning. It is basically a place where you walk up to the counter and order and they call your number when it is ready. Not a great experience to have when your eating at a barbecue place.<br /><br />I honestly had a very poor experience and will most likely never spend my hard earned money there again as there are far too many good venues for food around the San Luis Obispo County. The place was over priced and the service was not good. A lot needs to change before I consider eating here again.</p></div></body></html>
