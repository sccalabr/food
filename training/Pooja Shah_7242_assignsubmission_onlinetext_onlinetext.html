<p class="p1">Urbane Café is an American restaurant that serves mainly sandwiches and salads.  They also serve a variety of sides including fruits, soup, and assorted chips and cookies.  Urbane has a modern café setting with an outdoor seating area. It is located at the center of downtown San Luis Obispo and makes a great place for lunch or dinner during a day/night out in downtown.</p>
<p class="p2">Urbane café makes fresh focaccia dough every morning and bake a fresh batch of bread every hour. Their fresh bread makes the sandwiches taste fresh and good. They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from for both vegetarian customers and non-veg customers. Their sandwiches are not very expensive , they cost about $8, and every sandwich comes with a small salad. Urbane does not have any servers and the customers must pick up their own food when called. However, an employee came by the tables to make sure that everything was okay with the food. The employees all are nice and always have a happy attitude, which contributes to the casual atmosphere of the restaurant.</p></div></body></html>
