<p class="p1">WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p class="p1">Syrup Desserts is a small cafe located in the Historic Core of Downtown LA.  Syrup Desserts has delicious floats, waffles, ice cream and coffee.  Due to it's location, Syrup Desserts is always bustling with interesting people.  That is one of the things that makes it great.  Syrup Desserts has both, inside and outside seating.  It's close to libraries, bookstores, bars, other cafes and everything else that Downtown LA has to offer.</p>
<p class="p1">Syrup Desserts has the traditional drinks that you find at any cafe, plus original drinks like Habanero drinks.  They are spicy!  I recommend the waffles.</p>
<p class="p1">Syrup Desserts has great service, that is, when they are not busy.  When busy, the quality of the service is still good, but it's considerably slower.   I've walked out a few times.  </p>
<p class="p1">The venue itself is great too.  It has nice decorations, seating next to the windows and it has game boards on the second floor.</p></div></body></html>
