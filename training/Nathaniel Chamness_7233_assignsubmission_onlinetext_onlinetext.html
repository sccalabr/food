<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Jaffa Cafe is a Mediterranean restaurant. It is on Monterey Street pretty close to downtown San Luis Obispo. It is located next to Tacqueria Santa Cruz. It has a small shared parking lot in the back that is sometimes hard to find a spot in during peak hours, but is useful most of the time.</p>
<p>The gyros and shwarma wraps are amazing at Jaffa. For around $10 you can get a full meal with pita bread, meat, veggies, and hummus. They also have an assortment of sauces that you can add to whatever you get for free. One big plus is their big free water cups that are enough for one meal, you don't have to refill them like many other places.</p>
<p>The service at Jaffa has always been top notch. They trust you enough to order your food and eat it before paying without being a sit down place with a wait staff. After filling out your order on a checkbox sheet you wait until it is ready and then grab it yourself, it's so easy. The staff is always in a good mood and happy to see customers, especially the owner, he will ask you how your meal was and how your day is going. This adds to the overall vibe and keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>Lastly the venue is nearly perfect. It is large enough that it never seems too busy, but small enough to stay cozy. You can also sit outside under large sun umbrellas, but the sun will still come inside as they have huge garage doors that they open up. The tables and chairs aren't the best and don't really coincide with the theme of the restaurant, that's the only thing that I can really think of that's mediocre. Overall a great place that I recommend!</p></div></body></html>
