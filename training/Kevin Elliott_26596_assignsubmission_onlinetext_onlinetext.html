<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>The Santa Monica El Cholo is a Mexican restaurant located near West LA that has been around since 1997. It's part of a small chain of restaurants local to Los Angeles, but don't let that fool you into thinking that the quality of its food and service are merely run-of-the-mill.</p>
<p>The menu runs the gamut of the dishes customary of Mexican cuisine, including enchiladas, tostadas, tacos, burritos, and fajitas, all prepared with high quality ingredients such as hand-made flour tortillas and aged cheese. Many of the entrees have a "California cuisine" feel to them, such as the crabmeat enchiladas or theÂ spinach and corn vegetable dish. Prices are quite reasonable for a dinner establishment in Los Angeles, with entrees ranging from about $12.00 to $20.00.</p>
<p>The restaurant is popular and frequently crowded, but the staff always seems to be up to the task. Waiters and waitresses are prompt, polite, and responsive to customer requests. And if waiting for a table during peak hours doesn't appeal, El Cholo allows cutomers to make reservations and also offers online ordering for either pick-up or delivery.</p>
<p>The owners have clearly made customer convenience a priority. The restaurant is housed in a large, open building with balcony seating to support large crowds in a comfortable and pleasant environment. El Cholo is located in a busy part of town where finding parking can be a trying experience, so the establishment offers valet parking to its customers, taking a lot of frustration out the visit. Fans of Mexican cuisine will not regret making El Cholo a part of their dinner plans.</p></div></body></html>
