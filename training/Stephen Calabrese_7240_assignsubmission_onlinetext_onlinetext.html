The venue is a family run restaurant and is a dive of sorts.One might even consider it a "hole in the wall" joint. But what it lacks in physical appearance it makes up for in quality of and taste. It is located in Oceano, right on Highway 1 and has a couple of outside tables as well as a couple 4 seat tables inside. In fact the area it is located in could be considered sketchy. I personally do not like to go there in the evening when its dark just because of the area it sits in.But as is the true mark of a good eatery, the customers fill the place up around lunch and dinner with lines of policemen and auto mechanics etc. Most likely for the good menu, cheap prices, and quality of the food. <br /><br />The wait is usually lengthy as there is usually at least 4 or more people waiting inside this tiny little place. Why? Because anyone who is a local knows this place is the bomb! While the service is a walk up and take out place, the owners who work the counter are always friendly. Its best to call in your order and have it ready when you get there.Be prepared to wait if you don't,  but its OK because it is worth the wait.<br /><br />On my venture I had a simple bean and cheese burrito. This burrito was simply outstanding as the thing that sets it apart first and foremost is the tortilla is a thick, floury home made tortilla. The beans and cheese are of the perfect proportions and made with rich lard. This thing just melts in your mouth. I would eat another one if it wasn't so rich and filling. They do have most mexican items such as tacos, enchiladas, combination plates and daily specials.<br /><br />The price of their food is so reasonable you could eat here everyday which is hard to find in this day and age. My bean burrito which was a quite large  costs 2.99 and completely filled me up. All items on the menu are actually quite inexpensive and I was told by waiting customers that the enchiladas were another customer favorite at Chachos. I will be back again to try another item on the menu as well as my tried and true favorite bean and cheese burrito.While you will find many gringos here, you will also find many mexicans which I believe is a very good sign when eating mexican food. If you haven't tried Chachos, your definitely missing a hidden gem on the South Coast.</p></div></body></html>
