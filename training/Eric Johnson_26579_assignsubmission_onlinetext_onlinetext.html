<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>La Palapa's burritos are the best burritos I've ever tasted. I would probably pay more for these burritos considering how big and delicious they are. They are fairly pricy burritos, but it's basically like getting two burritos so it's totally worth it.</p>
<p>La Palapa is a sit down restaurant with a wait staff. The service could have been better. They got one of our orders a little wrong, giving me shredded instead of grilled chicken. Other than that, the waitress was friendly and checked in with us regularly.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at La Palapa is very ethnic. They have painted wood relief carvings hanging on the walls and other thematic decorations. The only thing I don't like is the chairs. They are woven chairs and fit in with the theme, but they aren't very comfortable.</p>
<p>Overall, La Palapa is above average. Their amazing burritos make up for the other aspects of their restaurant. I will definitely be going back.</p></div></body></html>
