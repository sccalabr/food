We came here on a Saturday during their happy hour and ordered a large Chicken and Garlic Pizza, pita bread on the side, and some beers. The food was delicious. It is definitely the bigest reason I come here so often.<br />The service has always been good. Most of the time they offer you free pita bread while in line. They even gave my group a whole tray for free before. They did, however, neglect to tell me the order of the beers in our beer flight, which was a bit of a bummer.<br />The venue itself is pretty nice and conveniently located. There is a good amount of seating, parking available most of the time, clean tables, and games on TV. I don't see anything really special about it that sets it over the top. It's just good.<br />Overall, Petra is a nice place to sit down and eat some good food. It is one of my favorite non-expensive places to eat in SLO.</p></div></body></html>
