<p class="p1">WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p class="p1">Sally Loo’s is just outside of downtown SLO. It is located on Osos Street, and a short walk from Terrace Hill. On the inside, it has a pretty cute atmosphere, with many interesting paintings, and a jar of spoons labeled “clean spoons” for coffee stirring. When you order food, you are given a little sign with an animal on it so that the servers can drop your food off later.</p>
<p class="p1">Sally Loo’s has very delicious food for a coffee shop. For breakfast, you can get things like acai bowls filled with fruit and granola, as well as more hearty meals featuring croissants, eggs, and bacon. All their ingredients are fresh and local. The coffee is among the best in San Luis Obispo. The portions are pretty small compared to other places, however. A typical breakfast will run you $13 plus a tip. If you want a lot of food on a budget, I’d recommend going somewhere like Del Monte.</p>
<p class="p1">Sally Loo’s service is up and down. It can get pretty crowded on weekends, and there are usually only two people working at the counter. So if you want a timely breakfast, you need to get there early. The servers are generally kind and hard-working, though. It’s just hard for them to keep up with the crowds.</p>
<p class="p1">Sally Loo’s is a great little coffee shop overall. If you don’t mind spending $15 or so, it is an excellent place to relax and eat at on a weekend. Come for the atmosphere and a small meal. Maybe eat a snack later in the day.</p></div></body></html>
