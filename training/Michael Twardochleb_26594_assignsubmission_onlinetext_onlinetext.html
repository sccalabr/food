Their location is convenient, and their service is always fast, but their food is only so-so.<br />The restaurant is on my way home from campus, so I often stop there, along with a lot of other students. The inside seating area is small, and the walls are covered with hand-painted pictures; there's also an equal-sized patio area outside. The bathroom is in the back, near the parking lot like at a gas station, which feels a little odd.<br />Their food is unimpressive (I'm from San Diego, so little Mexican food is here), especially for the price, but they have one-dollar tacos every Tuesday and Wednesday that I like to get. They have a lot of kinds of tacos, and none have been downright bad, but the asada, lengua, and barbacoa are the best I've had so far. Their salsa bar is disappointing because the salsas are generally sweetened and not spicy enough, but you do get free chips with even small orders.<br />If it weren't for the one-dollar tacos, I probably wouldn't go to Cinco De Mayo. Do show up for tacos though if you happen to be passing by on a Tuesday or Wednesday and want a cheap meal.</p></div></body></html>
