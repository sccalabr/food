The meats and cheeses were all good quality, provided in good quantity, and cooked right in front of you. While nothing exquisite, it certainly makes for a tasty place to grab a meal with friends.<br />The first time I ordered, the employee was very personable and offered good advice for which meals were a good first option. They give generous heaps of everything without asking, often grabbing huge handfuls of cheese and pineapple to throw on their grill. There were no waiters, but then there was no waiting either with how promptly they delivered your food. Friendly, helpful, and quick: what more could you ask for?<br />The location is small with only a few tables and old metal chairs outside. A dozen people would be cramped to all fit in there at once. If more than a couple groups are eating there, you're probably stuck eating on the curb. However, the place is kept clean, simple, and aesthetically pleasing, making it a somewhat homey place to eat.<br />I wouldn't consider Pita Pit a great place for a meal with parents or with a girl you're trying to impress, but it's perfect as a joint to hang out with friends. I've enjoyed myself thoroughly every time I've gone, if not with their flat iron chairs, then with their generous and delicious pita wraps. As a casual cave, I'd highly recommend it to anyone.</p></div></body></html>
