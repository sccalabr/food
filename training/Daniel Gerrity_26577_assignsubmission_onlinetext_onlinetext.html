WRITTEN REVIEW:

Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta is an Italian restaurant and pizza delivery
service. Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta has mediocre food and an average
number of choices. Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta is located in the Orcutt
shopping mall, in the original westernmost end of the south mall.

Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta is a good place if you want a ton of standard
Italian food and normal prices. The food is of decent quality and
comes in generous quantities. The typical main dish is $21.00, but you
are sure to take some home. Main courses of pizza and pasta come with the
usual variety of choices, nothing exotic.There are a few other entrees,
desserts and sides. The staff is friendly and the order times are short.
<br />The ambience is nothing special. Simple, generic art decorates the walls
around tables and booths. There are a handful of arcade games which may
improve or degrade the experience depending upon your taste and noise tolerance.

<pre>Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta has shared parking in the mall, as well as
dedicated parking behind the building. As the building is on the end of
the mall, rear parking is no more inconvenient than the mall parking.
There is also a dedicated rear entrance for patrons. Giavanni's Pizza &amp;
Pasta has one private event room with a window facing a spectacular view
over Orcutt valley. Only a few of the major credit cards and cash are
accepted. Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta's loaction is centrally located in
the new Orcutt area and only a five minute drive from historic Old
Orcutt. Overall Giavanni's Pizza &amp; Pasta is an average experience in
terms of food of and atmosphere, but that is offset by quantity of food
and favorably location.
