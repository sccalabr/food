Our group ordered the pad thai, chicken curry, and the pad see ew. All of them were pretty delicious. Their Thai iced tea was pretty tasty too. The prices aren't half bad either, which makes me want to keep coming back for more.<br />The service was exceptional. The staff were noticeably friendly, greeted you at the door, and served the food pretty quickly. My one gripe however knocks this place's venue score down two points however. Out of the five times we drove over to this place, they only ended up being open twice. This was all during their posted business hours. This made the place inconvenient with its hit-or-miss nature.<br />The venue was nice. It is in a small shopping center so there is a parking lot. The inside feels a bit small but it has never been cramped the few times I went. The tables are clean and the interior is easy on the eyes. I got no problems here.<br />All in all, I should rate this place five stars. Their food, prices, atmosphere, and staff are all top notch for what they are. However, the real toss up nature of whether they are open or not really takes a hit.</p></div></body></html>
