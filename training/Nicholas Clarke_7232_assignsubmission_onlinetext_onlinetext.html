<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Sylvester's Burgers is a popular burger joint in Los Osos. They serve large specialty burgers with unique sauces and toppings. Although they are most known for their burgers, there are other items on the menu. The french fries taste natural without an overdose of salt or oils. The milkshakes are served in generous proportions with quality ingredients.</p>
<p>The service at Sylvester's Burgers is average. A minimalistic register will take your order which will be brought out to your table. There is outdoor seating to compliment the limited indoor seating options. The food can take a lot of time to be prepared and may not come in the order it was ordered.</p>
<p>The venue of Sylvester’s Burgers emphasizes practicality while maintaining intimateness. The seating setup produces smaller 2-person alcoves as well as larger group tables. The decor includes photos of customers and other collectables, like hats and sunglasses. The background supports a blend of old music from the last few decades, adding to the restaurant’s quaintness.</p>
<p>Overall, I rate Sylvester’s Burgers highly at 4 out of 5. The inconsistent service brings the restaurant down a bit but is outweighed by the other factors. With delicious food and a friendly atmosphere, I would definitely return.</p></div></body></html>
