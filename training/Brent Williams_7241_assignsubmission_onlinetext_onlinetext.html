<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Subway is a common chain restaurant that you can find in just about any city. The food is just ok. It is not the highest quality but, in general, no matter what Subway you go to, it will taste the same. It is not very expensive. You can get a 6 inch sandwich for about $7. </p>
<p>At this particular restaurant, the lines are long around lunch or dinner time, making you wait around 10 minutes. Do not expect the greatest service. To them, you are just a number in their sandwich making machine, and while they might say, “Have a nice day,” it is usually without any real feeling. </p>
<p>Why do I keep going there? It is convenient, being in the middle of campus, but with very minimal seating inside, it makes it hard to eat there on a rainy day.</p></div></body></html>
