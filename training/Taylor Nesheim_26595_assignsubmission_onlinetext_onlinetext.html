It has the most delicious lamb gyros that I have ever tasted.<br />The service at Jaffa Cafe is a bit unorthodox but still good. You order first, get your food, then pay after you eat. Because of this level of customer trust I feel obligated to give them a five star rating.<br />They recently moved from an older and smaller building to their new place. It made a huge difference, in particular there are much more places to park now then there were before.<br />I would rate this restaurant with top marks. They have friendly staff, good ambience, and again their food is simply to die for.</p></div></body></html>
