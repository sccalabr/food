<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Sylvester's Burgers has the best burgers I've ever tasted. I would probably pay 50% more for these burgers considering how big and delicious they are. They have a large variety of toppings and meats to choose from, but I would get the same burger again because it was that good.</p>
<p>At Sylvester's, you pay upfront, then seat yourself, much like a fast food restaurant. However, they bring your food out to you and clear it away when you're done, so the service is a good value.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Sylvester's is like a smokehouse. This makes the rundown, almost dirty look acceptable, but not ideal. The only redeeming aspect of the facility is all of the pictures of customers on the walls which gives the restaurant a sense of community.</p>
<p>Overall, Sylvester's is above average. Their amazing burgers make up for the other aspects of their restaurant. I will definitely be going back.</p></div></body></html>
