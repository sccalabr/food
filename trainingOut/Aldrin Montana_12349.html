WRITTEN REVIEW:
Mee Heng Low is a noodle house with a vague resemblance to Chinese noodles. MeeHeng Low offers four primary options of noodles and several meat options. Ofthe noodle options there is chow mein, low mein, soup, and some other option.The meat options included chicken, beef, shrimp, and some others. The food wasdecent. The noodles were done well, though not served hot. The vegetables werea nice consistency, not cooked too long but cooked enough that they clearlywere not raw. The saving grace of the meal overall was the subtle yet sweettaste of the sweet plum sauce. However, this was not nearly what I expected (Iexpected a sauce more similar to Hoisin plum sauce) and so while I acceptedthat the food was not bad, it was still something of a disappointment.
The service at Mee Heng Low was standard. Once my order was placed and the foodwas finished cooking, it was brought to me at my table. However, my water wasrefilled in a relatively timely manner. I think our server went a step abovewhen he explained why a customer that had ordered his food after me receivedhis food before me. I feel like it could go either way, the server could haveeasily carried on without mentioning to me why my food was slower in getting tomy table. I appreciate that he explained it and I think that deserved a bump inMee Heng Low's otherwise average score.
Mee Heng Low had a very casual, cozy atmosphere to it. It felt like an urbanbuilding -- some pipes exposed and the walls made of brick. I liked theambience that the decorations had to offer, and I very much enjoy theatmosphere that Mee Heng Low has managed to establish in their building.
Overall, I think Mee Heng Low was a relatively average experience, with bonuspoints for the atmosphere and quality of our server. I would not go to Mee HengLow very often, but it is certainly a place that I wouldn't mind going toevery now and then, possibly even suggest going to.

WRITTEN REVIEW:
Upper Crust Trattoria is an italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food hasseveral very good qualities: very good taste (especially the soup), abundantbread (unlimited actually), and good proportions. Although I may have ate morebread than the average bear, I think that the size of the proportions leave yousatisfied and if necessary the bread is unlimited. Additionally, the bread goesmarvelously well both with the pasta sauce and the soup broth. The soup brothhad a very noticeable taste but not particularly overwhelming. The only problemI had with the food was that the pasta itself was not particularly flavored,but the meat (I had chicken marsala) tasted so absolutely wonderful it morethan made up for the lack of succulence in the pasta.
The service at Upper Crust was also very good. If my waiter was walking by thetable, we were sure to be asked how our food tasted and if we had any needs.The servers were also nice, appropriately talkative, and quick to smile.
Upper Crust had a definite atmosphere of elegance established. Much of thefurniture was made of some sort of wood, or made to look like wood, and thelighting was dim and warm. We had been placed in front of a fireplace (thoughnot lit) that even gave the restaurant a sort of cozy at home feel.Additionally there was an awesome drunk guy that tried his hand at chattingwith some ladies that was particularly amusing.
Overall, Upper Crust far exceeded my expectations. From the outside appearanceand the name I wasn't sure if the place was just a fancy pizza place beyond thelikes of California Pizza Kitchen. To my surprise, Upper Crust was a very greattasting italian restaurant with quite a bit of style and personality. I wouldhighly recommend Upper Crust to anyone and everyone (though it's expensive).

WRITTEN REVIEW:
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is a BBQ restaurant that primarily serves burgers, BBQribs, BBQ chicken, and various sandwiches. The selection was not terriblydiverse, but they had 'Killer Garlic Fries' which were sure to be a great hit.Sure enough, their BBQ tastes quite good and their garlic fries lived up to myexpectations of garlic-ness. Although, thinking back on it, it wasn'tparticularly memorable, so despite it being good and me quite enjoying it, Iwonder if it wasn't exceptional, hence the 4.
Service at Moe's smokehouse was wonderful, at least as far as BBQ grillrestaurants go. It didn't necessarily have the typical male server or registerworker that really gives BBQ or bar and grill restaurants a feel of ruggedness.However, the servers were quick to bring us our food, and despite not expectingany service they even asked if we needed anything a couple times. I think asfar as BBQ restaurants goes Moe's, at least today, had quite good service.
Moe's atmosphere was quite typical: A walk up register where you order, a sodafountain, and a look and feel very similar to most BBQ restaurants I've beento. Although, that being said, I also didn't pay much attention to any of theirpictures and artwork. I may have missed out on the appeal of the restaurantitself but I didn't think there is anything I would consider memorabledecorating their walls.
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is exactly what you would expect, plus bonus taste andservice. I think it is definitely a good place to go every once in awhile. Ofcourse, being a BBQ restaurant it shouldn't be frequented too often, but theprice is affordable for a fair amount of food (including a lot of fries) andthe overall experience is quite comforting.
