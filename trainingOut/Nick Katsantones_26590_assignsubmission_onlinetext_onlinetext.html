WRITTEN REVIEW:
The Upper Crust Trattoria is an Italian and Mediterranean restaurant. The Upper Crust's food is delicious, but slightly expensive. The Upper Crust is located in the Laguna Village Center.
The Upper Crust Trattoria is an amazing restaurant which offers a wide range of food. They offer pizza, fish, pasta, steak, and salads. The food is cooked very well and is worth the price. They typically rotate what they offer on their daily specials, however they were sold out when I was there.
The Upper Crust Trattoria has decent venue, however it is not a fancy restaurant. When I arrived I was immediately greeted and seated. The staff was very prompt up until the point I got my food, after that I saw my waiter once before my check.
The Upper Crust Trattoria is great if you want amazing food without a lot of involvement on the part of the staff. The price point detracts a bit from the overall experience; a filet mignon and drink came out to around $35 before tip. However, The Upper Crust is a restaurant that I will absolutely go to again.
