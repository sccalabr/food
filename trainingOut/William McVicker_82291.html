WRITTEN REVIEW:
Bel Frites specializes in selling good Belgium fries.  They serve several different seasoned fries like ranch or jalapeno fries.  They also sell really good jalopeno poppers.  They also sell beer here as well.  The only downside is that the portions are fairly small.
The service at Bel Frites was pretty bad considering they only sell fries.  It took about 15 minutes for us to get our fries and jalopenos popper and it wasn't even busy.  The cashier also got my order wrong and gave me the wrong size.  When I went back to order more they corrected it for the new order, but didn't give me anything special for messing up my first order.
The venue itself was actually good.  They are open really late and hence a good place to go after the bars to get some tasty fries.  It can get crowded since there is limited seating.  Its a cool place to grab some food while hanging out downtown.
Overall, Bel Frites is a decent place to get some tasty fries.  They have a bunch of different seasonings and dipping sauces that are greate for a late night snack.  Even though the service isn't that great and the seating is limited, the food is worth it and can be taken to go.  It is also a great place to get meet up with people since it is centrally located downtown.
