WRITTEN REVIEW:
Spikes is a bar. It really does not have that great food. I has some kick ass beer however. If you take a bunch of friends and order pitchers you really won't care about the food for very long.
Service at spikes is very hit or miss. If you go late on a Saturday when they are packed you won't get service but you can always go up to the bar and order. We usally order so pitchers and stop noticing that there is not service.
Spikes is all about the people that you bring. It isn't a great place to meet people but it is a great place to bring a lot of friends and get a ton of drinks.
Spikes is just  a fun bar to start out the night. Go there with friends to pregame and move on to some other bars as  the night goes on.
