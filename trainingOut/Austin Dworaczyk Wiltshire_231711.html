REVIEWER: Austin Dworaczyk WiltshireNAME: Goshi Japanese RestaurantADDRESS: 570 Higuera StreetCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 4SERVICE: 5VENUE: 4RATING: 5WRITTEN REVIEW:Goshi's is much more than just a standard sushi restaurant, and it is clear in the restaurant name that it is specifically a Japanese food restaurant, not just sushi. Practically anything you get off of the menu will be guaranteed to be good. The albacore tataki is quite good, as well as the Goshi's Best sushi roll.
Our server for the night was excellent, always smiling and more than happy to accommodate our split checks, as my girlfriend and I were there on a double date with some friends. We got our food quickly, with only one small delay for my girlfriend's small salad. Really, not much more can be said about the service, it was exactly like anyone would hope.
The venue at Goshi's is authentic to say the least, and by authentic I mean small. It's tucked away off the street, and you practically have to know it is there to find it. They have many many tables tucked in throughout the room, so you have to watch were you are walking when you go to or from your table. It would be nicer if there was more room to spread out between, but it's not the fault of anyone really, they just need a bigger space at this point. When we arrived, the place was already filled to the brim, and we had to wait a few minutes to find a table, but only a few.
Overall, Goshi's is an excellent restaurant, with good food and great service, if a somewhat smaller venue. It's definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance!
