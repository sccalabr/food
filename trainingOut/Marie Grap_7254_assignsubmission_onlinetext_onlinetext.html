REVIEWER: Marie GrapNAME: Denny'sADDRESS: 208 Madonna RdCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 2SERVICE: 2VENUE: 4OVERALL: 2WRITTEN REVIEW:My boyfriend and I went to Denny's because we were hungry and we didn't have any food. We ordered an Oreo milkshake, a Grand Slam, and a pancake puppy sundae. The food was reasonably priced, but the quality was lacking. The milkshake was almost warm and the pancake puppies were overcooked.The service was unpredictable. When we first arrived, it took the hostess five minutes to seat us, even though there was nobody else waiting and the restaurant was uncrowded, and another 5 minutes to provide us with menus. While we were deciding what to order, our waitress asked us if we were ready to order three times within a five minute time span, which made us feel very rushed.The venue was clean and tidy. Seating was limited to the tables near the front of the restaurant because it was later in the evening.Overall, I would rate our experience as below average. However, we will probably visit again because the food is cheap and it is open 24 hours.
