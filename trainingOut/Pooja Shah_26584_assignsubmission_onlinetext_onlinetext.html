WRITTEN REVIEW:  
Pizza Solo has a wide range of dishes to choose from, such as calzones, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. Their food is decently priced which makes it a great place to get lunch or dinner for families and college students alike. In addition to the food, the staff is also great. Pizza Solo has a very casual atmosphere and also has an outdoor seating area. They are located off the main street so the surrounding area is not very loud. Unfortunately, Pizza Solo does not have their own parking lot therefore, one must either park on the street or the parking structure. The location of Pizza Solo makes it a great place to stop by for lunch or dinner for anyone spending the day downtown.. It is off the main street and in a small walkway between Higuera and Marsh.
