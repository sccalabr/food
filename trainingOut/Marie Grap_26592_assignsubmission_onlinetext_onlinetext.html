REVIEWER: Marie GrapNAME: Bon Temps Creole CafeADDRESS: 1000 Olive StCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 4SERVICE: 5VENUE: 3RATING: 4WRITTEN REVIEW:Bon Temps Creole Cafe is a local business that serves authentic, home-made creole cuisine. The quality and quantity of the food is good for the price, although I wish there had been more variety, especially for the beverages offered. Â The venue has a fun, Mardi Gras-esque atmosphere. Unfortunately, the venue is not well air-conditioned and it was very warm even though it was later in the evening when I arrived. They do offer outdoor seating, but it does not have themed decorations so it is quite dull. In addition, the outdoor dining is right next to a popular freeway on-ramp, so it can get noisy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the food they serve. My party and I were not very familiar with creole food, but our waitress was very accommodating and answered all of our questions thoroughly and politely.My party and I enjoyed our meal and had a positive experience with our first tasting of creole food. Although the venue was somewhat lacking, our overall dining experience was pleasant and I am looking forward to my next visit.
