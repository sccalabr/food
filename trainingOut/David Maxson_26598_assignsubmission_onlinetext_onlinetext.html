It tasted delicious, wasn't too hot, and was served in generous portions. Given the very reasonable prices, I hadn't expected such good food, and certainly hadn't expected so much of it.The service was minimal, but extremely prompt. We were seated immediately, our orders taken within minutes of sitting down, and food ready in an unbelievably short time. Though the waiter had difficulty with English and didn't check up on us much, what he did at all he did supremely well.The venue was beautifully decorated, not as pink as the photos I'd seen had made it seem. The restaurant was a little tightly packed, and simply arranged, but left plenty of room that you felt like you were generally private and on your own. Also, there were very few people and no wait at all, which is almost a shame for such a great restaurant.Overall, the food was excellent, the service was incredibly prompt, and yet everything oozed with simple quality and humble incredulity. I can hardly wait to visit again sometime soon.
