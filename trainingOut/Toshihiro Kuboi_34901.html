WRITTEN REVIEW:
SUMO SUSHI offers sushi and other Japanese dishes as its name suggests. I did not expect to have good Japanese food there but to my surprise the food was good. I had Alaskan Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll and Salmon Egg sushi. The Alaskan Roll was very good. It is a roll of rice wrapped by raw salmon. The salmon was soft and tasty. The salmon egg sushi tasted just as I expected. I marked one point off because the spicy tuna roll was not what I expected: It was spiced by Jalapeno instead of Wasabi.
The service I got at SUMO SUSHI was OK, but I felt that its ordering system was bit strange: I ordered sushi to a waitress but she told me to tell the order to one of the chefs who were cooking sushi behind the counter. But to order other things like beer, I had to tell a waiter not the chefs. I witnessed a strange thing there: A guy who was sitting close to me said "two more beers" to a chef and the chef replied, "No thanks. I am drinking water." The guy shook his head and told the order instead to a waiter who was standing nearby.
Although its entrance looks shoddy, SUMO SUSHI is spacious inside and can seat many people. It has many tables for groups of many people and many seats for 1 person or two people at a long counter. I marked one point off because its entrance looks shoddy.
Overall, SUMO SUSHI is a good restaurant. Although it does not offer real Japanese food, it is a good place to eat sea food cooked in Americanized Japanese style.
