WRITTEN REVIEW:

Pepper Garcia's is a Mexican restaurant and bar which also provides catering services. Pepper Garcia's has above average food but only an average number of choices. This restaurant is located on the east end of the Santa Maria Airport terminal. Parking is convenient, with its own parking lot separate from the airport parking system and both dedicated and terminal entrances. Pepper Garcia's is on technically on Terminal Drive, but as part of the main airport complex, it is more practically described as on Skyway Dr. between Broadway and Fairview Dr., in Santa Maria, Ca. Pepper Garcia's has its own parking lot immediately to the east of the terminal with nice landscaping and a special path leading into the airport building. Because Pepper Garcia's is immediately beside the tarmac, reaching the parking lot requires navigating the airport's normal parking system to the terminal, which is somewhat inconvenient.

Pepper Garcia's is a nice place to treat yourself and friends when you are looking for a great meal at an affordable price. The food is of consistently high quality. The menu, while not comprehensive, offers a varied choice of burritos, tacos, grilled dishes, soups, and a respectable array of side dishes. Order wait times tend to be a bit long, but unlimited chips and salsa are served as soon as you are seated, which help to soothe growling stomachs. Iced water with floating lemon slices quench your thirst when the salsa starts to heat up your mouth.

The atmosphere of Pepper Garcia’s is above average. There are extensive interior decorations including full wall murals, ethic floor tiles, and a very unique belt-driven ceiling fan system. However, the full effect of being adjacent to the runway is restricted by the paucity of glass facing south. Pepper Garcia’s employs a fully bilingual, friendly, serving staff. This staff consistently serves their customers with the highest degree of professional standards. They are courteous and attentive. Besides normal waiting service, Pepper Garcia's occasionally holds temporary “buffet days” which diversifies the dining experience.

Pepper Garcia's also has a full service bar in-house and a private event room for special party reservations. All major forms of payment are accepted and Pepper Garcia's supports all usual advanced reservation arrangements by phone. While the airport is an interesting location, it is quite removed from the normal commercial districts in Santa Maria. It is a full 10 minute drive to downtown. Overall, Pepper Garcia's offers a significant above average dining experience in terms of food, service and atmosphere, but that is balanced by a somewhat inconvenient location.
