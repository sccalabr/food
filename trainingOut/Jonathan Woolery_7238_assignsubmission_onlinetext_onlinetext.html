WRITTEN REVIEW:
McPhee’s Grill styles itself as a fine dining restaurant slash steakhouse. The lunch menu still has a couple of steak options but most of the lunchtime offerings consist of burgers and pizzas. The price for a McPhee’s burger at lunch is a bit above average. McPhee’s is located on Main Street in Templeton. McPhee’s has a host and a single waitress during the weekend at lunch time.
At McPhee’s you will pay more than you are used to for a hamburger lunch. If you are a fan of huge juicy burgers with loads of flavor on a delicious bun, this cost will be well worth it. The burgers come with a side of fries that lack any of the flavor and culinary inspiration that goes into the burgers. The server at McPhees was exceedingly attentive. Drinks were refilled promptly. The atmosphere was not particularly special but the restaurant was clean and quaint. The overall experience is above average because the high quality of the food and service and the quaintness of Main Street in Templeton. I would recommend this restaurant for people who are looking for a flavorful if slightly overpriced lunchtime burger.
Templeton is a very small town, so it is relatively difficult to miss McPhee’s on a drive down Main Street. McPhee’s has several specialty pizza’s on their menu and is better known for it’s dinner menu which has a larger selection of offerings from the grill. McPhee’s also has some seafood on their menu. 
McPhee’s is not a speedy dining experience. At McPhee’s you can expect to sit down and spend some time with your dining companions. The service is not slow, but nothing about the experience is rushed either.
