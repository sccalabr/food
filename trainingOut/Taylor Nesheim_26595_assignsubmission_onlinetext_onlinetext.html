REVIEWER: Taylor NesheimNAME: Jaffa CafeADDRESS: 1308 Monterey StreetCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 5SERVICE: 5VENUE: 5 RATING: 5WRITTEN REVIEW:The food at Jaffa Cafe is in a word amazing. It has the most delicious lamb gyros that I have ever tasted.The service at Jaffa Cafe is a bit unorthodox but still good. You order first, get your food, then pay after you eat. Because of this level of customer trust I feel obligated to give them a five star rating.They recently moved from an older and smaller building to their new place. It made a huge difference, in particular there are much more places to park now then there were before.I would rate this restaurant with top marks. They have friendly staff, good ambience, and again their food is simply to die for.
