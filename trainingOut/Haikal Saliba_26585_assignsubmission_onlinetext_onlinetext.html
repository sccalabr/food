WRITTEN REVIEW:
 Tacos de Acapulco has, hands down, the best burritos in San Luis Obispo (and the Central Coast as far as I'm concerned). Their Carne Asada is their best burrito in my opinion, but everything there is exceptionally tasty as well. You can tell all the food is homemade, as well as Mexican drinks. I've never had a bad experience with their food.
There is only one register, and it tends to get really crowded during lunch. Ordering might take as long as 5-10 minutes. However, the chefs are really quick with food preparation, so the total wait time is never more than 10 minutes. The credit card machine is also really old and flimsy, and takes a couple of tries to work and a long time processing. Their food is also slightly expensive compared to other Mexican places.
The venue is really old, and pretty small. There is outside seating, but it is limited to two tables. Inside, people have to walk through the dining area to order food, which could be annoying for certain eaters. However, there's a traditional Mexican feel to the venue, and they even have a karaoke machine which I've had the misfortune to hear one of the chefs perform on. I usually get my burrito to go, but I've had pleasant experiences dining there as well.
Overall, Tacos De Acapulco is well worth the visit. It has been my go-to Mexican place for a couple of years now, and hasn't let me down ever. Even though the venue, service, and pricepoint are not perfect, the quality of the food definitely makes up for it. I would recommend it to anyone.
