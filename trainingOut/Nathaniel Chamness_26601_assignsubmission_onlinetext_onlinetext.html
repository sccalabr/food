WRITTEN REVIEW:
Pluto's a made to order sandwich and salad place. It is located in downtown San Luis Obispo at an accessible location. The inside is very nice for a place with quick service. It has a minimalist style which I like.
Behind the order counter all the ingredients are freshly prepared. I went with a friend who said that it was a good sandwich place in SLO. I got a chicken sandwich that was pretty good, but the chicken seemed a bit dry to my taste. The onion rings were ok. I thought that I was going to like it more than I did, I probably won't go back any time soon.
Even though you can sit down and eat, there are no servers at Pluto's. You tell a worker what kind of sandwich/meal you want and any sides or condiments you want added. There weren't that many people when eating when I went so I was able to get my food quickly.
Overall Pluto's is a good place if you want to get a quick sandwich. It is a little expensive, but it is similar to other restaraunts in SLO. I probably wouldn't go there very much as Chipotle is around the corner if I need a quick meal.
