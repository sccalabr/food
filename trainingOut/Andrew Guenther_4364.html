WRITTEN REVIEW:
Chili Peppers is a burrito joint close to the Cal Poly campus. Their menu includes a wide offering of burritos, tacos, tortas, and more. The burritos are resonably inexpensive and delicious for the price. Whenever I have Mexican food at home, I find myself craving Chili Peppers. During this particular vistit, I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito. The shredded chicken is juicy, tender, and full of flavor, but the rice  truly seals the deal. Chili Pepper's rice has an excellent flavor and I often find myself scraping the last morsels of it off my plate.
The people at Chili Peppers are all incredibly friendly, and often strike up conversation with my rommates and I during our weekly visits. Our food is always made correctly and finished quickly, making it a speedy and inexpensive dinner stop.
Chili Peppers location leaves a bit to be desired. It is not the cleanest joint and the tables are rarely bused. On the flip side, parking is easily accessible and is located very close to campus.
Chili Peppers provides a fantastic burrito for the price, but isn't without its "hole-in-the-wall" Mexican food quirks. They are always polite and quick, making them a joy to visit and get my weekly burrito fix!
