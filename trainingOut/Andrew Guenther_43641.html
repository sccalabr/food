WRITTEN REVIEW:
Metro 19 is a buffet style restaurant on the Cal Poly campus. The food was alright, a bit cold, but edible. Eating it was not the problem, it was the terrible stomach ache I suffered an hour later. I had to skip class because my stomach hurt so badly. Avoid at all costs.
Many of the buffet platters were near empty and no one was in sight to refill them. Someone did kindly come and take my plate when I was finished eathing though.
I ducked in to Metro out of desperation. It was 100 degrees outside and all I needed was some food and a cool place to sit. Thankfully Metro was nice and cool inside and not too crowded either.
Overall, I cannot recommend Metro. The food is mediocre at best and likely not even safe to eat. Not all the air conditioning in the world could make up for the stomach ache I had after leaving.
