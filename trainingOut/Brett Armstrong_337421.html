REVIEWER: Brett ArmstrongNAME: Pizza SoloADDRESS: 891 Higuera StreetCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 5SERVICE: 5VENUE: 3RATING: 4WRITTEN REVIEW:Pizza Solo makes excellent pizza. As the name suggests, their specialty are 'solo' personal pizzas. They have a wide variety of choices, including my favorite, 'Bowser', which has chicken with a ranch-sriracha sauce. Their cheesy breadsticks are also delicious.The employees at Pizza Solo are super nice. Even when it gets busy, the food never takes very long. I have never had a bad experience at Pizza Solo.Pizza Solo needs a bigger patio. They have an awesome location downtown, but it has almost no patio seating, so they have to put tables in the courtyard. These tables are often packed together tightly to make room for people walking by. If they were able to expand their patio, you could enjoy this city's great weather without feeling like you are eating in the middle of traffic.I would highly recommend Pizza Solo. You can always get the pizza you want because they are personal, and its even better when you can swap a slice of this for a slice of that with a friend. I have liked every pizza I have tried, and there are still a bunch on the menu I have yet to try.
