Its location is convenient and the food is fresh, but the portions leave something to be desired and the layout has some issues.On first impression the venue is pretty nice. There is a decent outside seating area at the entrance that is elevated and fenced off from the street, but half of the tables are plagued by the smell of garbage wafting from the trash cans in the corner. Upon entering you'll be blasted with sound by their door-mounted air conditioning unit, which is really inconvenient because the line to order extends to the door, and the noise makes it difficult to converse with any companions. The inside is unremarkable, with the kitchen area comprising most of the middle space and a walkway that passes by the kitchen to a rear seating area. The soda fountain is placed immediately across from the kitchen area, where you pick up your own order, in what is clearly an attempt at convenience, but in reality is a terrible idea because it creates high traffic at the narrowest point in the establishment.I ordered a B.L.A.T. (Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, and Tomato sandwich) from the "Beef" section of their menu, expecting those items to be present in addition to some sort of roast beef, but the sandwich came with only those items onboard. Apparently whoever made their menu didn't get the memo that bacon comes from a pig. The bread was good, as one would expect from freshly-baked bread, and it was a tasty sandwich, but it was not nearly filling enough with only a few slices of bacon for protein. The sandwich came with a house salad, which was well-dressed, but was not large enough to compensate for the miniscule sandwich. It was a disappointing meal for the eight dollars I paid, but the flavors and texture were good and the food was clearly fresh, so I'll call it so-so.Urbane Cafe is an unremarkable entry in San Luis Obispo's dining scene. It's too expensive for what it offers, and the venue is poorly laid-out. Some value could be added if the wait staff actually delivered your food to the table, but they opt instead to use those blinking LED squares to notify you when your food is ready to pick up. I probably won't go there again unless I get a strong craving for mediocrity and unfulfilled hunger.
