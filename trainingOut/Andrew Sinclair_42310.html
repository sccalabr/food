I went to G. Brothers during their happy hour. The tacos are only $1 and delicious. The amount of food you get for the price is awesome.
The service is pretty minimal. The food was prepared quickly and the staff was friendly. The tables are cleaned regularly.
The venue is like most other BBQ restaurants. They have picnic style table cloths. There is plenty of seating. It doesn't seem like anything is missing.
Overall G. Brothers is a great restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious, the service is fine, and the venue is standard for a BBQ restaurant.
