WRITTEN REVIEW:

 

Firestone is one of the most, if not the most well known restaurant in San Luis Obispo. When my parents or anyone I know comes to visit, this is the first restaurant they go to. They are known for their signature tri-tip sandwich. It is slow-roasted, juicy tri-tip smothered with their own barbecue sauce served on toasty garlic bread rolls. It is so good and filling that I try to not go too often. I don’t want it to become something I am used to. It is a treat that you should enjoy.They also offer everything you could find at a usual grill such as burgers and salads.

 

The service is always good. They greet you with a smile and they have never given me a wrong order.

 

The venue has a lot of outside seating some next to warm fireplaces that are lit on cold nights. There is not much inside seating, and it is always load due to the many sports games that are shown on the tv’s that line the walls but with the San Luis Obispo weather, I’d rather be sitting outside anyways.

 

The food is great, the venue is good and the service is good too. Overall it is something that you should not miss whenever you visit San Luis Obispo.
