WRITTEN REVIEW:
Charlie's Place is a Mexican restaurant which has a heavily Americanized menu. Charlie's Place has moderate-high priced food. Charlie's Place is located next to a gas station. Charlie's Place has an outside wooden patio area. Charlie's Place has a well stocked bar.
Charlie's Place has a very large food menu offering a variety of food types. The portions were large, and they allow many different substitutions/additions to the food. The restaurant also allows people to just buy drinks and watch TV. The price of the food wasn't extremely high; I paid $8.25 for a 1/3 lb buffalo burger. The price of their drinks is extremely high; $6.00 for a beer. The food was very delicious and filling.
Charlie's Place had excellent service. The reason I gave them 4 out of 5 is because there was no one at the entrance when I arrived and no sign indicating that it was a seat-yourself restaurant. The staff was very friendly and I received prompt service once I sat down. The staff cleaned the tables within minutes of patrons leaving.
Charlie's Place has sparse decor. Most of the decorations would be classified as 'southern' rather than 'Mexican'. The restaurant also had a few sports themed decorations. The restaurant has several televisions located throughout the inside. The staff allowed the patrons to choose what channels they wanted to watch.
