WRITTEN REVIEW:
Taco Roco is a local Mexican restaurant/taqueria chain, with a couple of locations around town -- I went to the one on Santa Rosa street. The place is a fairly typical Mexican burrito/taco/etc. joint, serving authentic dishes (compared to, say Taco Bell), but is otherwise unexceptional. The food is decent, but not a very good value for the price. The service is on par with â€œto-go  restaurants, and is fairly speedy. The interior gives off a â€œhole-in-the-wall  vibe, which tends to be okay for taquerias like this.

I tried their carnitas burrito, which was a little pricey for what I got, but arrived hot and was flavorful and authentic. There weren't many other people there ordering food, so I didn't have to wait long for it. It wasn't the best burrito I've ever had, but certainly acceptable for what's available in SLO.

Taco Roco is not an exceptional restaurant, but it's not bad either -- certainly not as taquerias go. Unfortunately, the food is pricey given the small portions and average quality. Everything else, like the service and atmosphere, are average at best, but taquerias such as this one don't set the bar too high in general.

Overall, don't come here with high expectations, but do come if you've got an empty stomach and the place across the street is closed. If you feel like eating actual Mexican food, and not a cheap imitation, Taco Roco is good choice over the neighboring Taco Bell. However, if you're used to taquerias that cater to a clientele who know â€œgood  Mexican food, you still may be disappointed by Taco Roco.
