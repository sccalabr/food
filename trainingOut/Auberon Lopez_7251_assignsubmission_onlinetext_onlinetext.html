WRITTEN REVIEW:
Kokoro is a sushi joint popular among Cal Poly students due to its close proximity to campus and its relatively inexpensive sushi. While it won't be winning a Michelin star any time soon, it's a fun relaxed place to grab some sushi and sake with friends.
The atmosphere is an odd mix at Kokoro. Tacky paper lanterns hang next to TVs that inexplicably play virtually nothing but competitive poker. Cheap frames adorn the wall, complete with the stock photographs that they came with. The tables are a bit cramped together, especially by the door and register where hungry patrons wait for their take-out.
These cramped walkways present a significant challenge to the single, tragically overworked waiter. Both times I have visited, he was the only one waiting tables despite the restaurant being nearly full. He works extremely hard, literally running from table to table, but he cannot do enough to compensate for the fact that there are simply too many guests to be served by a single person.
When the food finally arrives, however, it proves to be well worth the wait. There is a vast selection of rolls to choose from at Kokoro, and I have yet to find one that disappoints. The fish is fresh and the composition is creative. The presentation on some of the specialty dishes is Instagram-worthy. All of this comes at relatively modest prices, but it is still sushi; don't expect to walk away with both a full stomach and a full wallet. If a couple of sake bombs can convince you to look past the tacky decor and understaffed service, Kokoro is well worth a visit.
