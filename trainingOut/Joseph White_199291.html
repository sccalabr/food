REVIEWER: Joseph White NAME: Linnaea's Cafe ADDRESS: 1110 Garden Street CITY: San Luis Obispo FOOD: 4 SERVICE: 5 VENUE: 5 OVERALL: 5 WRITTEN REVIEW: Linnaea's has some of the best coffee around San Luis Obispo. Their espresso is my favorite around town, and their pastries are usually top-notch. They have an amazing rhubarb tart that is my usually my first choice; however, they were out  so I had a brownie, which wasn't too bad. The service was very good. The staff was very friendly, and was quick to make my drink. There was also a very cool design in the foam of my cappuccino which showed that the barista had great attention to detail. Linnaea's is a great place to hang out and talk with friends. The inside seating of the cafe was pretty crowded, but it was a nice day, so sitting outside was fine. There is a nice seating area in the back, with lots of plants and shade: very comfortable. Linnaea's is one of the best cafes in town. It's small, has great coffee, and makes you feel like you're right at home. It's also right in the middle of downtown SLO, so it's usually a quick walk from shopping and other restaurants.
