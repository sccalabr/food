REVIEWER: Jacob BustamanteNAME: PetraADDRESS: 120 Higuera StreetCITY: San Luis ObispoFOOD: 5SERVICE: 4VENUE: 4RATING: 4WRITTEN REVIEW:Petra is a Mediterranean restaurant located on Higuera Street just a couple blocks up from downtown SLO. We came here on a Saturday during their happy hour and ordered a large Chicken and Garlic Pizza, pita bread on the side, and some beers. The food was delicious. It is definitely the bigest reason I come here so often.The service has always been good. Most of the time they offer you free pita bread while in line. They even gave my group a whole tray for free before. They did, however, neglect to tell me the order of the beers in our beer flight, which was a bit of a bummer.The venue itself is pretty nice and conveniently located. There is a good amount of seating, parking available most of the time, clean tables, and games on TV. I don't see anything really special about it that sets it over the top. It's just good.Overall, Petra is a nice place to sit down and eat some good food. It is one of my favorite non-expensive places to eat in SLO.
