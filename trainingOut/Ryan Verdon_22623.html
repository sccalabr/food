WRITTEN REVIEW:
Melo’s is a pizza and pasta restaurant. The pizza I ordered was amazing. The price of the pizza was also excellent.
Melo’s normally has excellent service, but this time I had a lousy experience because of the waitress serving my table. First, we had to ask several times for plates. Second, I ordered Diet Pepsi but after the waitress refilled my glass she gave me regular Pepsi. Lastly, the waitress took forever to bring us our check.
Melo’s has plenty of parking. Inside Melo’s there are plenty of tables to sit at. There are several televisions inside on different sports channels.
Melo’s is an amazing sit-down pizza place. It offers great food at a great price at a location that is easy to get to. Unfortunately, service can very drastically depending on what waitress you get.
