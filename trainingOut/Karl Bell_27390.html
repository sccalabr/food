WRITTEN REVIEW:
Raku Japanese Fusion Cuisine is primarily a sushi bar, but they also provide a number of other food options (noodles, tempura, etc.). I went there shortly after watching Tampopo, a Japanese film about a noodle restaurant, so I ordered spicy ramen. The food was quite good and the prices weren't that high for a Japanese place, though that isn't saying much. The ramen I had was prepared well, and the broth was quite good. Along with that, I tried a caterpillar roll, which was pretty standard, compared to other sushi places in SLO. We also tried the dessert which they called "Vanilla Maki." It was just some ice cream wrapped in what they said was cookie dough, but it tasted and felt more like fondant. The dish as a whole was really pretty bland.
The service was not very attentive. I ran out of water a number of times and had to wait until I saw our waitress again before I could ask for more. After we finished our food and had resolved to try the dessert, it took about 10 minutes before someone else (not our waitress) came along and asked if we needed anything. We ordered the Vanilla Maki but they still hadn't cleared out table when they brought it, even though it was fairly obvious we were done when we ordered dessert. Of course, all of this was likely just due to them being quite busy that night, so I'm not sure I'd judge their service based on just this experience.
The restaurant is a really nice place. The decoration is well done, with decorative umbrellas serving as a ceiling and very interesting lighting fixtures. There was even some accent lighting on the sushi bar which changed colors, which we thought was very cool. The layout is pretty sensible, though a bit cramped (especially when it is crowded, which it was when we went).
It looks like the place may be a lot better for lunch. They had a separate lunch menu which had some interesting options on it, and I'll probably return for that. The dinner experience was alright, but I think I'd rather go to one of the other sushi bars in town over this one.
