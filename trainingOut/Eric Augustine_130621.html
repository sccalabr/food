WRITTEN REVIEW:
Olive Garden is a large chain of typical Italian restaurants. The food is pretty good, but I little more expensive then it should be. My meal cam with soup and breadsticks with as many refills as you want. Both the soup and breadsticks were pretty good. The pasta I got was very tasty and fresh.
Our service was pretty good. We were seated quickly, and the server never made us wait long. However, she forgot one of our orders and had to come back and ask again. Also, there was some confusion over one of our orders and she was not clear about what a dish has. So, Aldrin got an order he did not really expect.
The venue was fine. It was clean and wel lit, but nothing special. It was a sterotypical American Italian restaurant. The outside of the restaurant with really nice with some grass and a nice stone path.
Overall, the experience was very nice but nothing too special. It was more expensive than it should have been, but pretty tasty.
