WRITTEN REVIEW:
Kokoro Sushi and Grill is a sushi bar that also features Korean and Japanese entrees. The food is well priced, but sushi tends to be more expensive compared to other meals. Kokoro has its own parking lot and is white on the outside. Kokoro’s employees mostly speak English and some may speak Korean. Kokoro is on 1065 Olive Street and Santa Rosa Street.
Kokoro provides a plethora of sushi dishes as well as Korean and Japanese entrees. The sushi dishes are varied from sauce heavy and traditional so there is an option for any sushi lover. The entrees include Japanese dishes such as BBQ bento boxes, gyoza, and teriyaki bowls. Korean dishes include bibimbap and kimchi. There are so many choices here there’s no way to go wrong.
The service at Kokoro is lacking. The arrival time of meals may be permissible during busy hours, but I was in one of two parties at Kokoro and was disappointed in how long it took to get my meal. My meal came well after everyone else’s so there was an awkward period while everyone was waiting for my food. What was worse was the behavior of the server. He seemed unhappy to be working there.
Kokoro has a great location. It is off of a main road (Santa Rosa Street) and is easily accessible. Also, the parking lot is never full so there is always parking. The interior is also beautifully decorated with pictures on the walls and gorgeous paintings.
