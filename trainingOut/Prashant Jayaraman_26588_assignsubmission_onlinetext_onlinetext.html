WRITTEN REVIEW:
High Street Deli's sandwiches are very good.  They use very fresh ingredients, and the special herb juice they make adds a nice tangy flavor to the sandwiches.  The Mother Nature sandwich in particular is loaded with fresh vegetables.
Though the place often gets crowded, High Street Deli has surprisingly fast service.  Even on a Saturday afternoon, it only took a few minutes for my sandwich to get made. 
There are only a couple tables at High Street Deli, so you may have to eat your food somewhere else.  However, a lot of customers take their food to go, so there is usually an open table or two.  There is a lot of paraphernalia covering the inside walls of the venue, so you will have something to look at while you're waiting for your sandwich.  The overall look of the place is casual and laid back, which fits the food being served.
Overall, High Street Deli is a great lunch choice.  The sandwiches are quite possibly the best in San Luis Obispo.  Despite its popularity relative to its small size, service is fast.
