WRITTEN REVIEW:
Fish Gaucho is an upscale (read ‘expensive’) tequila bar / restaurant. The menu is inspired by the food of Baja Mexico. The Californian Mexican food menu has many seafood options as well as chicken beef and pork. The decor follows the modern trend towards rusticness made classy. The prices are almost exclusively in the higher range for comparable food at other restaurants. Fish Gaucho is located on Park Street in Paso Robles, near many other restaurants in the vicinity of Paso Robles City Park. Fish Gaucho is staffed by a great number of hosts and waiters that are adequately attentive.
At Fish Gaucho your hunger and taste buds will be intrigued at the sight of the food approaching other diners’ tables. The descriptions in the menu will be enough to make your mouth water. You will ignore the high price-tag and eagerly pay fourteen dollars for a burrito. The food will arrive and your taste buds will be left wondering what is missing. The tables are a bit small for the size of the plates which results in a relatively cramped dining experience. Rave reviews from friends lead me to believe that I must give this restaurant a try, but nothing I tasted or experienced will compel me to return. 
While at Fish Gaucho my companions and I sampled a variety of different dishes. The scallops were more chewy than they should have been. The Braised Short Rib Chile Verde was lacking in the desired amount of chile and flavor. The Lobster Enchiladas were found to be very enjoyable and flavorful, but the price of $26 for a few enchiladas with no side left the value of the meal questionable. 
On their website Fish Gaucho’s owners brag more about their tequila and cocktail menu then they do about their food. I must confess that none of my dining companions ordered any of their cocktails. Perhaps tequila was the missing ingredient to our meal. Regardless of this possibility, I plan on spending my dining-out money elsewhere.
