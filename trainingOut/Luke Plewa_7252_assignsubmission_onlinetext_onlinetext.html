WRITTEN REVIEW:
Cream Pan is both a Japanese bakery and a Japanese restaurant. Cream Pan has cheap food. Cream Pan is next to a bus stop. Cream Pan has its own parking lot. Cream Pan is beige on the outside. Cream Pan's employees mostly speak English. Cream Pan is on 6th Street and El Camino Real.
Cream Pan is an excellent bakery and is perfect for breakfast. They feature an assortment of freshly baked goods as well as lunch platters. Their strawberry croissants are award winning and are featured in many news articles. They also have Japanese specific baked goods such as azuki cream pastries made with red bean. Their curry comes with chicken or pork katsu and is more than enough to fill your stomach.
Cream Pan has a significant downside in the amount of traffic it brings in. It is not rare to see the line extending out the door. This is especially common during peak hours. The wait is definitely worth it, but it may be worth considering visiting during off-peak hours so as to avoid the line. The hours are at or after open time (6:00 am - 8:00 am), as the baked goods are freshly made and no one is awake yet to create a line. Even though the line is very long, there are many employees during peak times. The line moves quickly and it is noticeable how hard their employees work.
Cream Pan shares a parking lot with a couple other restaurants, but they are not nearly as popular as Cream Pan. Despite having a shared parking lot, there is still plenty of space even at the busiest hours. The parking lotâ€™s significant size means there will always be a place to park, but there will not always be close spots. Luckily, most people come in and out so you may get lucky and find someone leaving a spot close to the restaurant. Unfortunately, not all people will be pleased with the interior. The tables and chairs give off a hipster vibe as they seem to be secondhand. Despite a rustic feel, some people may prefer higher quality chairs and tables.
