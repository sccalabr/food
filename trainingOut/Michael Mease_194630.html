WRITTEN REVIEW:
I chose G-Brother's as an alternative to Firestone, and it was a decent choice. The place is fairly small, but has good food and moderate prices. I enjoyed the meat and the rolls were really tasty as well. The serving size was modest but well worth the price.
The food came out pretty quickly for a sitdown restaurant, but ordering to-go seems like a bad idea unless the place is empty. The line doesn't move too quickly but it wasn't very long either, so the service was pretty average. The employees were nice and suggested specials, but nothing too extraordinary happened during my trip here.
The building is very small, but has a good atmosphere. Televisions with sports and a dozen scattered tables make this place a great hang out spot for a sunday night. The order area seemed a bit small, but the restaurant seems like a hybrid of a to-go and a sit-down, so that was not too bad. My experience eating there was good enough and definitely made my meal taste a little more authentic.
Overall, G-Brother's is a great convinient spot to get some BBQ. The service is decent enough and the venue is pretty good since it adheres to a western BBQ joint's style. I only tried one item on the menu, but I would be willing to go back and try more.
