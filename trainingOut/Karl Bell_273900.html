WRITTEN REVIEW:
Round Table Pizza is a chain of pizza places. They serve pizza and sandwiches, along with a number of other sides. We ordered a special which included two pizzas and an order of the garlic parmesan twists. The pizzas we ordered both came with creamy garlic sauce. The sauce was alright, though it was a bit too creamy, to the point that it seemed rather like having cream spread on the pizza. The toppings and crust were alright; about the same quality as other chain pizza places. The garlic parmesan twists, though, were actually quite bad.
The service there was pretty good for a pizza place. Self-serve refills give them few chances to mess up, though. They got our order mostly right, though they brought ranch with the garlic parmesan twists, rather than marinara. They did bring marinara right out when we pointed this out though. Other than that, all the service was was taking the order and bringing it to our table.
The restaurant is alright. When we went around 6 o'clock, though, the sun shining in through the glass storefront was really bad. Only three tables were out of the sun, two of which were occupied when we came in. Luckily, we were able to take that last table, otherwise I would have had to squint at my food the whole time. They should probably invest in shades or something.
It looks like the place may be a lot better for lunch. They have an all-you-can-eat deal then. I'll probably return for that, though really the food wasn't that great. This is certainly not my favorite pizza place in town. In my opinion, Woodstock's is better pizza, and Fatte's or Papa John's will give you better value.
