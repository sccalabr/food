WRITTEN REVIEW:
Denny’s is a breakfast food restaurant similar to IHOP. Denny’s has cheap delicious food at a great price. The pancakes I ordered were amazing.
Denny’s had excellent service. The waiter was extremely fast at getting us our drinks, food and our receipts. All of the staff members were really nice to us.
Denny’s has an alright location. Unfortunately, when I went there was no parking so I had to park at the hotel next door. There were plenty of tables inside to sit at though.
Denny’s is an excellent sit-down breakfast restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. The staff was extremely nice to me. Sadly, when I went the parking lot was full. Besides that I highly recommend Denny’s.
