WRITTEN REVIEW:
Louisa’s place is a diner located downtown. They serve traditional American diner food. Their menu is enormous and you can order pretty much any breakfast food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with hashbrowns. The food was pretty good, the breakfast sandwich was pretty much what you can expect, bacon, cheese, egg, and english muffins. The hashbrowns were also decent. Overall the food was pretty average.

Louisa’s place gets pretty packed on a Saturday morning so we opted to sit at the bar. The servers were pretty quick to get our order and checked up on us on regular intervals. The servers were pretty friendly and overall provided good service.

Louisa’s place looks like a traditional diner with lots of pictures on the walls. The inside is pretty small but that didn’t stop a lot of people from eating there. It looked as though a lot of regulars came there since the waitresses knew them all by name. The cramped and crowded space made it a little harder to talk and overall the experience was the same as an average diner.

Louisa’s place is a friendly diner downtown. The prices aren’t the cheapest and food isn’t the most revolutionary. It also gets pretty crowded however, the service was good and everyone generally has a positive attitude. Overall if you want a decent diner experience you should try Louisa’s.
