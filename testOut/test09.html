WRITTEN REVIEW:
Sally Loo's focuses on fresh, natural foods. The food is pricey but definitely tastes good. The coffee prices are pretty standard for a coffee shop, but the coffee is much better than many local coffee shops. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the prices.
The cafe is setup so you order at a cash register and have your food delivered to your table. The staff is willing to help with most requests. Sometimes the complimentary water is empty, but it is refilled when a customer asks for it. On a busy day the food can take a while to be prepared.
The venue is great if you're a hipster. The cafe is filled with art from local artists and unique decorations. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, as well as seating for large groups, small groups, and single diners.
Overall Sally Loo's is a great cafe. The food is tasty, the coffee is amazing, and the venue is unique. It is a bit expensive, but I think the extra cost is worth it.
