WRITTEN REVIEW:
Sal's has some of the best sandwiches in Downtown SLO. There is a wide selection of great sandwiches, with lots of topping options. Everything is fresh and their sandwiches seem perfectly constructed.
The service is pretty much what you'd expect. Unfortunately, they did make a small mistake on my sandwich, but were very apologetic and gave me the forgotten topping on the side.
Right in the middle of downtown, Sal's is a great place to hang out for a bit. There is lots of seating both inside and out with bit tables incase you have a large party. The outdoor seating is great on nice days.
If you're looking for a great sandwich downtown, Sal's is definitely the place to go. They also have a pretty wide beer selection if you want to try some out which you enjoy your sandwich. You also get a lollipop with your sandwich for dessert!
